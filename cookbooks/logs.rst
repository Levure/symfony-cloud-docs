Logs
====

The log messages generated by the different tasks running on an application
container can be accessed via the ``log`` command:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # display all messages from all log files
    $ symfony log all

    # display the messages of a specific log file
    # (the argument is the name of the log file without the '.log' extension)
    $ symfony log error

    # display the messages of several log files
    $ symfony log app error

As explained in the next sections, the exact log files available depend on the
application container in use. `Log rotation`_ is not enabled by default, but
each log file is limited to 10 MB in size automatically because
:ref:`log files are counted towards your disk quota <config-disk>` (if a log
file reaches that size limit, older messages are discarded).

.. tip::

    In addition to the ``log`` command, log files are also accessible via SSH
    in the ``/var/log`` directory of the application container.

.. note::

    Although the ``/var/log`` directory is writable, it should not be written
    to directly. Only write to it via standard logging mechanisms, such as your
    application's logging facility.

Deployment Logs
---------------

``deploy.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``deploy`` log contains the output of the most recent runs of the
:ref:`deploy hook <deploy-hook>` for the container. If there is no ``deploy``
hook then this file will be absent.

``post_deploy.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``post_deploy`` log contains the output of the most recent runs of the
:ref:`post_deploy hook <post_deploy-hook>` for the container. If there is no
``post_deploy`` hook then this file will be absent.

Application Logs
----------------

``app.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Any log messages generated by the application will be sent to this file. That
includes language errors such as PHP Errors, Warnings, and Notices, as well as
uncaught exceptions. It also contains your application logs if you log on
``stderr``.

.. tip::

    When running a Symfony application, the ``log`` command also gives access to
    the log files stored under ``/app/app/logs/*.log``, ``/app/var/logs/*.log``,
    and ``/app/var/log/*.log``:

    .. code-block:: terminal

        # tail on /app/app/logs/prod.log
        $ symfony log prod

``cron.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cron`` log contains the output of all recent executions of
:doc:`cron jobs </cookbooks/crons>`. If there is no cron hook specified in the
container configuration or if no cron has been executed yet, then this file will
be absent.

``php.access.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a PHP container, the ``php.access`` contains a record of all requests to the
PHP service.

Nginx Logs
----------

``access.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the raw access log for the nginx instance running on the application
container. That is, it does not include any requests that return a redirect or
cache hit from the router.

``error.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nginx-level errors that occur once nginx has fully started will be recorded
here. This will include HTTP 500 errors for missing directories, file types
that are excluded based on the ``.symfony.cloud.yaml`` file, etc.

``nginx/error.log``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nginx startup log messages will be recorded in this file. It rarely happens
except when debugging possible nginx configuration errors.
